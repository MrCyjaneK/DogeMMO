==== Error handling
For errors that are 'soft', you can use following format, simply redirect to this url:
<?= WEB ?>/inc/soft_error.php?e=URL ENCODED MESSAGE

For critical errors that shouldn't happen if user act normally, use this:
<?= WEB ?>/inc/error.php?e=URL ENCODED MESSAGE
NOTE: This will also kill session and re-login will be needed.

example php code that handle error:

<?php
// Keep in mind that this code won't work in any of plugins/* because content is already sent to browser. So better use meta tag of js to redirect
if (isset($error_message)) {
    header('Location: '.WEB.'/inc/soft_error.php?e=error');
    die();
}
?>
==== Exception handling.

For exceptions use strings, like:
throw new Exception('404|not found');
Where part before | is error code.
