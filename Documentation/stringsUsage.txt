Every part of game should use 'gs' function (previously 'getString')
 ---------------------------------------------
 - Previously I've had similar approach like -
 - android apps do in in strings.xml         -
 - action_go_back would return 'Go Back'in   -
 - english and 'Powr√≥t' in Polish.           -
 ---------------------------------------------

But now I've decided to use something else.
Simply use gs('Go Back') and then. This will
be much cleaner for translators and developers
to use this.
